To Create new table in the database, 
1. Run `npm run db:create (table name)`
2. Update the generated file in the /migrations folder with what the table needs to store
3. Run `npm run db:migrate` to create the tables that the migrations folder defines
4. To reset created databases, run `npm run db:rollback`. Assuming that each migration file has an exports.down function defined:
    exports.down = (pgm) => {
        pgm.dropTable("(table name)");
    };


To Connect to DB in console:
1. run `psql -U postgres -d monopoly`
2. Enter password (pw is password)
