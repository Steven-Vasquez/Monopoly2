# Online Multiplayer Monopoly

This is a fork and redo from the ground up of a college class group project. We developed an online version of the popular classic Parker Brothers/Hasbro board game, *Monopoly*. As part of this project, we got the essential web app components up and running but needed more time to make a proper working game. In this version 2.0, we hope to make our game playable while improving our methods, polishing the UI, and becoming better programmers and developers. Check out the GitHub repo for our [version 1.0](https://github.com/Steven-Vasquez/Monopoly) that started it all!
